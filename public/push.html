                HTTP/2 permits requesting many resources at the same time.  To facilitate this demonstration,
                each image has been subdivided into tiles, and latency added to each request.

            <h6>What's happening?</h6>
            <p>
                Each picture is made up of a series of 80 tiles, each of which must be downloaded from the server.  HTTP/1.1
                can request up to six tiles at a time, and must wait until one of those six complete before requesting the
                seventh, and so on.  If your browser supports it, HTTP/2 can issue all 80 requests at once.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTTP/2 makes the most difference on a higher-latency link.  In order to simulate this, both the HTTP/1.1 and
                HTTP/2 endpoints are equipped with a network emulation tool that injects an extra 100ms of latency into the
                connection.
